A cross-platform PowerShell module for interacting with the NordVPN API.

## Introduction
This module provides various functions for retrieving country, grouping,
 technology, and server information from the web API provided by NordVPN.
 Possible filter parameters are generated dynamically by retrieving lists of
 valid entries from the API. A list of countries, groups, and technologies is
 stored locally as an offline fallback, and these can be updated.
